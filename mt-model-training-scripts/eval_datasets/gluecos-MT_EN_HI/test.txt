Hello! How are you? Have you seen any good movies recently?	 
Can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently?	 
Hello! 	 
Yes, I just watched La La Land	 
Have you seen it?	 
No, I haven't. Is it any good?	 
Well, I don't know how you feel about romantic comedies 	 
I'm usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine 	 
I like them. What's this one about?	 
Also just visually beautiful  	 
In what sense? Where does it take place?	 
It's about a actress and a musician.	 
they meet and fall in love in LA while pursing their dreams	 
It sounds like something I would watch. Than you for the recommendation!	 
Yeah, it has a bunch of great scenes where the two don't quite connect 	 
like one where the girl, Mia hears the boy,  Sebastian playing the piano  in a bar but he brushes her off 	 
How do they fall in love then?	 
Well they meet for a second time at a party and Seb is in a 80's cover band. They have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while	 
Then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates	 
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the leads	 
I wasn't sure about those two to start out with, they just didn't seem like they'd be good together  	 
Are there any other famous actors beside Emma and Ryan?	 
John Legend has a small role	 
Does he get to sing?	 
A bit. He has a duet with Emma. He also sings a song or two by himself 	 
Do Emma and Ryan sing well in the movie?	 
They weren't the best signers I've ever heard but it wasn't like Le Mes bad	 
Sebastian character is sort of annoying. I mean he's into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician , but is a compete snob about it.  Def not a likable character even towards the end really 	 
What about Emma's character, is she likable?	 
She is. I enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and I was caught up in the emotions during this scene. She's such a great actress that the execution  is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend 	 
During this time, Seb feels so out of sorts. the band he's in is finding success in pop music but because he's such a jazz pureist, he wants to quit	 
Do they make it in the end, both as a couple and in their respective careers?	 
He doesn't because he loves Mia so much he wants to make her proud	 
Sadly no. they drift away as their careers go in different directions. He misses an important play and she moves back home	 
So it ends a bit sadly then. But I guess that's how real life goes.	 
it's a big "wrong place wrong time" kind of ending, which sucks because you really start to root for them. 	 
Yeah, I really liked the ending, while it wasn't perfect, it was real	 
Something you don't get with movies most of the time	 
I agree	 
One of the things I wasn't a fan of was the fact that  Mia  didn't really have any development. 	 
In what sense?	 
Career wise or personal like?	 
More personal really. She lacked depth. She was just an actress who tried and failed many times then found success  	 
But we weren't shown how she found the *thing* that helped her grow and become a better actress	 
I might have to watch it to see what you mean. I think failing and trying again shows real depth.	 
the movie just jumped forward passed that. Seb didn't have much growth either. He stayed a jazz snob	 
Ok. Thank you. Bye!	 
I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!

I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!	 
Wonder woman was awesome, and was a hast introduction to the character. Well it was her first full length movie. 	 
I think using love to fight war is the same old thing.	 
The woman leaving her home to be with the man is the same old thing that always happens in movies 	 
You should try watching the 1975 film jaws!  It has a rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.  	 
I think I saw that many many years ago.  How many Jaws movies did they make?	 
I am not sure on that but spielburg is blessed with talent many moviemakers dont posses.  He actually know how to tell a story!	 
He did make many good movies.  What are some of your favorites?  Was this the first time you saw Jaws?	 
Yes, it was the first time.  To gruesome for children to watch.  	 
I think I was pretty young when I saw it the first time.  I remember blood, but not all the gruesome scenes.  I doubt my children have seen it.	 
Hello there.	 
Hello how are you?	 
I am doing great, thanks for asking.	 
You? :)	 
Great thank you! Are you an animation fan?	 
Very much so!	 
What is the title of the movie?	 
I don’t know if you’ve heard of this little animate feature call... Toy Story lol	 
Lol, hilarious, you kidding me? Of course! Arguably the best of all time!	 
I love that movie, it helped me as a kid to take care of my toys, and I am being serious.	 
I didn't want to end up like Sid. LOL.	 
Yeah it kinda difficult to get someone into this film since everyone is. Whose your favorite character by the way?	 
Haha, no need in trying. I love Buzz because he was hilarious in the Tea party scene haha.	 
How about you?	 
I love Woody! He’s a really sassy cowboy! I loved the scene where Buzz found out there were other versions of him	 
It was like an existential crisis	 
Slinky Dog was one my favorites too because when I was a kid I had a dachshund dog. :)	 
I mean I also loved Woody, he is always there for you, I just wanted Buzz because he was hilarious haha.	 
Ohh yeah.	 
It felt genuine at the time or maybe the movies execution for the scenes were just so perfectly done.	 
Oh I had one too! He was a really cute yet reliable character with his slinky ways. Mr potato head is delightful as well	 
I hated Mr. Potato head!	 
Yeah it is a perfect animated featureb	 
He was so panicky hahaha.	 
And good to know you had a dachshund too! Interesting. :)	 
He almost killed Woody! >:(	 
Nooo! I had him as toy so he’ll always be in my heart 	 
Hahaha.	 
I forgot about that scene. Now that you think about it.... naw I still like the guy	 
I want to remove his nose and stuck into Buster's poop.	 
Lol! Now which one wade Buster? Was he the pig?	 
No, Busty is Andys dog. By the way I'm just  kidding, yeah he is like the dad kind of role in the family of toys since well, he IS Mr. Potato Head. Hahaha.	 
I always forget that Woody had a girlfriend BoPeep! I heard the 4th movie they’re making is about 	 
Them finding her 	 
I wish it is still perfect. I don't like the idea of movies surpassing a trilogy but that is just my opinion. But I always trust Pixar haha.	 
Oh no I agree with you wholeheartedly the trilogy ended to well for there to be a continuation. 	 
And yeah, Bo peep. I was heartbroken when Woody was counting their lost family members since Andy was growing old.	 
And Woody said Bo peep, that was heartbreaking.	 
I know, it was the perfect trilogy.	 
Yah. Thank you so much this was a great conversatilm	 
Ok good bye.	 
I love home alone when it came it, great movie!	 
Oh yes. I enjoyed watching it with my family growing up.	 
it was hilarious how macaulay culkin got the crooks so many time 	 
Yes. He's a clever boy. I wouldn't have been able to think of half the tricks	 
The Shape of Water was pretty good, I'd rate it as one of Guillermo del Toro's best movies.	 
Yes it is good	 
Sally Hawkins is mute in it, which is impressive as an actor.	 
She is very good	 
Doug Jones is in it too, he does great creature work.	 
Who does he play?	 
I believe he plays the captured humanoid amphibian creature	 
He was very good	 
Yeah, the reviews were pretty much unanimously positive.	 
Yes	 
The story is pretty interesting too, has fantasy elements.	 
Yes	 
The main character is an orphan who was found in a river.	 
Interesting	 
She eventually learns to communicate with a creature she finds at her work.	 
That's good	 
She eventually keeps the creature in a bathtub.	 
The RottenTomatoes score is 92%.	 
That is very high	 
Yeah, and the the users gave is 8.4/10	 
Also very good	 
The Metacritic score is 87/100	 
That is very good	 
and the CinemaScore is an A	 
It has good reviews from everyone	 
The movie is a bit violent though, as long as you don't mind that.	 
That's ok	 
There's some scenes with the use of guns.	 
Also ok	 
It shows people dying on screen too.	 
That is sad	 
There's also some nudity.	 
Hi there!	 
Hello!	 
Have you seen Inception before?	 
I have, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  How about you?	 
It's been awhile, but I've seen it too. It was really good!	 
I had partly forgotten about the love story aspect of the film.  You?	 
Somewhat. I haven't seen it in a few years.	 
But reading the introduction makes me want to watch it again!	 
I haven't seen it since it came out, I don't think.  I just remember loving the dream aspect of the film.  Reading the introduction makes me want to watch it again too!	 
It's definitely an original idea.	 
Indeed.	 
I like how every dream seems like it starts in the middle of the action, just like real dreams	 
Me too!  I also loved how Ariadne had to construct each dream level	 
Do you remember the train that plows through downtown LA?	 
No, I had forgotten about that part entirely.	 
:)	 
I remember jumping in my seat because it was so startling.	 
I remember jumping quite a bit during Inception!	 
I don't agree with the fact that the document says the genre is "scientific". I think the movie's  more of a thriller.	 
I think they meant to say "Science Fiction"	 
There is certainly a thriller aspect to it, but it's solidly sci-fi	 
That's true.	 
Do you remember your favorite scene?	 
I think my favorite bit was actually at the end, when you're not sure if Dom is in reality or not...when the scene cuts away from the top before you know if it stops spinning or not.	 
Ooh, I loved seeing that part in the theater! As soon as the screen cut to black, you could hear everyone's frustration!	 
yes!  	 
I really liked when everyone woke up on the plane. You get so invested in the dream layers, that you forget where it all started.	 
Yes, each dream layer was a world in itself!	 
Do you like sci-fi movies in general?	 
I do.  I adore sci-fi. You?	 
I think we're on the last page of the document	 
I love it too. I also enjoy movies that mess with your mind, or give you something you weren't expecting.	 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're done.	 
Me too.  The more unexpected, the better!	 
Hello, have you seen the movie Despicable Me?	 
no, never saw it. any good?	 
It was quite cute! Created by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, the main story follows an aging Supervillian named "Gru."  Gru has a posse of "minions" who do the heavy lifting for him.  	 
It has a funny title. 	 
so i guess Gru is despicable?	 
It does: but, it's appropriate.  One of the central conflicts in the film revolves around Gru's perception of himself.  As the "super villian", he sees himself as a "despicable" person. However, during the course of the movie, you see that he actually has a very big heart	 
He ends up adopting three girls and learns to parent creatively and ends up choosing "his girls" over the chance to be the bigger villain on earth.	 
Is it an animation?	 
Yes!  And, a well crafted one, at that.  It was produced by Universal.   It's obviously digitally animated.  More along the lines of Pixar movies.  And, the soundtrack is amazing.	 
Interesting. is it kid friendly?	 
Very much so!  But, as a bonus, there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents.  It's definitely appropriate for a family movie night.   The overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork.	 
Steve Carrel does some amazing voice work, as the main character.	 
Ah that sounds good...though I wouldn't mind seeing this plot with Catwoman in the lead	 
What tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned.	 
I'm not sure Cat Woman would fit well, in this case.  Really, It pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the  stereotypical "crimes" they often pursue.   Gru, in this movie, wants to steal the moon...but is foiled by another up-and-coming super villain.  In the end, he ends up giving the moon to his girls...which is  a cute stereotype of a good father.	 
 Pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it: the lyrics are peppy and comical.  There are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together.	 
wow...that really sounds original. never seen anything like that	 
It is an original concept, for sure.  If you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor, the minions have  you covered. They often get themselves into very Rube-Goldberg-esque shennanigans.	 
I liked Monsters ( the movie). in it the monsters are under the bed, but turn out to be friendly. Great movie to take the kids to. 	 
It received numerous, positive reviews. I would recommend seeing it.  Kids will definitely like it.8	 
Any superheros?	 
Well, that's the take away- being a super hero or a super villain is entirely your choice. Gru ends up being a super hero by vanquishing Vector (the up-and-coming villain).	 
So, would you go see this movie?	 
Sometimes I think my kids will choose the latter. I need to indoctrinate the better.	 
Yeah. gotta organize a movie night for it. popcorn, etc.	 
did u see it with kids, btw?	 
Sounds like a good plan.  Make sure you have bananas- the minions like them.	 
Yes, I saw the movie with my children.	 
They liked it?	 
They loved it.  They spent the next few days speaking in "minion speak".  	 
uh-oh	 
It's not a bad thing.  Have you ever listened to kids try to speak pig latni?	 
hey now	 
Hi good day	 
indeed it is. shall we talk movies?	 
Our Movie was titled SUPERHERO	 
how descriptive	 
who in it?	 
It was Directed by: Jon Favreau	 
oh yeah? What year did it come out?	 
It was filmed 2008	 
what was the Rotten Tomatoes score, then?	 
The actor was Robert Downey JR	 
Have you watched this movie before?	 
Oh, my god. I love actors. were there any others?	 
I h aven't seen it, no	 
Ahaha sorry the title was Iron Man.. my mistake ohh my	 
no, I didn't see it. 	 
I think you watched this movie also	 
ohh 	 
The guy has a suit, though. An iron suit	 
Yes it was 	 
tell me about a character	 
i you want. no pressure	 
Robert Downy Jr played Tony Spark	 
oh man. that sounds great. who else was in it?	 
The billionare who's in the fire arm business	 
alright. Sounds good.	 
Was it well regarded by critics	 
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, an industrialist, genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. ● Terrence Howard as James "Rhodey" Rhodes, a friend of Stark's, and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. ● Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Stark's business second-in-command, mentor and friend who turns on him to overtake the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. ● Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest "to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him", and who helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit. ● Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest.	 
you're not supposed to do that, dude.	 
Yes.. Rotten Tomatoes: 94% and average: 7.7/10 Metacritic Score: 79/100   CinemaScore: A	 
ohh sorry 	 
Did not know cant copy	 
yeah, you can't just copy/paste what would be the point?	 
I was trying to just give some information	 
we're done though anyway. rember next time	 
good chat!	 
ohh yes yes.. 	 
thank you good chat to you	 
hi there	 
how did you enjoy jim carrey movie bruce almighty	 
hey	 
I liked it a lot	 
jim carrey was the right choice with that movie	 
how about you?	 
i agree, i thought the movie was funny	 
well, the critics do not say the same thing	 
the ratings are very low for both rotten tomatoes and metacritic	 
i see thats lol n its sad	 
now I remember Jennifer Aniston was also in that movie	 
those ppl who felt like that move wasnt funny are the same ppl who thim amy is funny	 
on her favorite times	 
I think those people did not like the idea of Morgan Freeman as a god	 
thats more that possilbe	 
possible	 
i think he did a great job tho 	 
which scene do you remember and like the most?	 
when he brought the moon close to her 	 
i thought it was super romantic	 
:) yes doing that thing without thinking any consequences	 
n wen he made her boobs big with her knowing	 
did jennifer aniston know that he has god powers? I do not remember that part	 
not at first she didnt	 
I like the way he was responding the prayers by email :)	 
i think he told her tho i cant remember	 
letting everyone win the lottery	 
yea that was cool	 
I am not sure about that part either, I think he did not tell her	 
I did not like the end of the movie though	 
it was too dramatic for a comedy movie	 
lol i mean he was playing god so it had o be a lil dramtic	 
dramatic	 
yeah but still, Jim Carrey's having an accident and the whole love drama	 
the movie is still great though for my taste	 
yea ot was	 
it	 
Thanks for having the chat	 
it was nice to talk	 
same enjoy ur day	 
I think I may re-watch the movie sometime soon	 
bye	 
Hi there, this is like one of my favorite movies	 
It was really hard to see the puppy get killed, it evoked so many emotions of sadness and anger!	 
Hi! Do you like it? I loved How Keanu Reeves acts	 
yes , he is awesome in it!	 
I like how the clean up crew comes in too....they are comical! lol	 
haha, yes, there were so many action scenes for they to clean after	 
doesnt like a cop how up too thats a friend? 	 
I find it hard to believe rotten tomatos ratings also! it should be like at least a 8 or 9!	 
I think you are refering to Alfie Allen performance. That was not shi top notch	 
Even CinemaScore, that usually is more reliable, only gave it a B	 
BTW, I can't believe in was released 4 years ago	 
I mean, the movie is still fresh and with so much style for a crafty revenge thriller	 
the cop knocked on the door after a scene and he opens the door and the cop is like "is everything ok" lol and he is like yeah. it was comical. 	 
John wick 2 was actually terrible, nothing as good as the first one 	 
I also like the bellman at the hotel.  played by Lance Reddick	 
the ending is really good to when he gets another dog!	 
Andd you wouldnt want to get in the bad side of Ms Perkins, played by Adrianne Palicky	 
oh right, she plays a good character  	 
Oh!, I liked also the Mustang that starts the second scene	 
Also, highly recognizable, that's a plothole in my opinion	 
yeah so many nice cars, reminds me of fast and furious	 
that is a good scene they are refering to, when Aurelio tells him something like john wick is the boogeyman or something lol	 
I liked that , by the way of the Mustang stealing, it gets establshed the previous story of Jhon Wick as a top assassin.	 
yeah it would be nice if they came out with a pre sequel, is that a prelude? like showing him in his past days and his wife	 
hello! 	 
Hi!	 
Did you see The Shape of Water?	 
I  have heard about it	 
I never seen it before. Please tell me about the film	 
Well it's a really good movie, what kind of genres are you interested in?	 
I like action, comedy, horror type of movies	 
Well, it's a fantasy/Drama film. 	 
I figured it was a drama film	 
who is the main character?	 
It's about a mute cleaner and she works at a secret government lab	 
ok. sounds interesting. did she witness anything she did not suppose to at her workplace?	 
Yes, a mysterious creature shows up one day and she is intrigued and decides to visit him and they form a close bond.	 
So the figure became her best friend, huh?	 
i mean creature, sorry	 
What happens next?	 
In some ways. She feels like they understand each other because she's mute and he doesn't judge her just like she doesn't judge him for being a strange fish creature.  	 
Oh.. that's sound very interesting. Do they have to face any enemies in the film?	 
Well this film takes place back when prejudice is still very common, and the main character is best friends with a black woman and a gay man, so it really delves into that 	 
Yes, the main antagonist is the man who brought the creature to the lab, Richard Strickland. 	 
So there is a bit of diversity in the film, that sounds cool. 	 
So the guy was going to do a experiment on the cre ature and the mute lady will stop him? Or that isn't true?	 
Yeah he wants to kill the creature to study it and she hatches a plan with her friends to help save him	 
Wow I kinda figure that. 	 
It's got really good scores on all the movie rating webpages	 
I'm not surprised,. Did Shapes of water won a Oscar?	 
Yeah it won a lot of them. 	 
The plot seems pretty good to me so it is definitely   award worthy	 
It's a really different movie, it's been one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. 	 
The ending is really good too	 
I were going to ask what happens at the end but I will wait to see it	 
I enjoy chatting with you. have a good day	 
Thanks you too

Would love to hear about it	 
Great. Well it is a biographical crime directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, and Amy Adams (to name a few).	 
Awesome cast!	 
Any reviews?	 
Yes, the movie received a 96% on rotten tomatoes, but got a 76/100 on Metacritic.	 
As one critic responded "this is not a major Spielberg film, although it is an effortlessly watchable one"	 
Pretty good score	 
What’s the story line?	 
The story line is about the life of Frank Abagnale (Leo DiCaprio) who is a con artist who conned millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor.	 
Cool. Think this was based on a true story	 
Yes, this was based on a true story, though there are certainly some artistic licenses throughout the film, but the nonetheless a good watch with great acting.	 
The beginning of the story is great because it tells how Frank had a hard time financially and how he fell into conning as a way to get by	 
I’ll have to check this one out for sure. Ah that makes sense, the beginning set up the plot for conning	 
Yes, it's quite interesting because he relies on forging checks so there is some tense moments where you're kind of rooting for him even though he's a con man. The premise is in the title "Catch Me If You Can". 	 
Of course	 
At one point, Frank is arrested an taken to jail and there is a flash forward where it skips in time, but eventually Tom Hanks (Carl Hanratty, in the film) convinces the FBI to take Frank on to work with them.	 
Bet he was a good worker for the fbi. Knowing all the little tricks criminals use	 
Exactly, but when he works there he starts to get the itch to get back into conning, and Carl (who works at the FBI) is constantly worried Carl is gonna disappear again	 
I would too. Don’t blame him for worrying. 	 
Frank* is gonna disappear again. Sorry for the typo, got excited!	 
I’ve heard of this movie but don’t remember seeing it	 
All good!	 
It's great. Care to hear about the ending?	 
Sure!	 
I’m all about spoilers lol	 
Well Frank settles down at the FBI (its assumed), and as the credits roll it is revealed the Frank has been married and happy for 26 years, has 3 sons and lives in the Midwest and still maintains a friendship with Carl.	 
He made millions calling out money forgers and also made millions creating unforgeable checks	 
ah mean girls. such a funny movie. have you seen it? 	 
Yeah, even though I love comedies, this wasn't 1 of my faves	 
how come. thought tina fey's writing was fantastic in it. she did an amazing job adapting a self help book	 
I loved the story & how true they made it in how  teen girls act but I honestly don't know why I didn't rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there. I cannot believe it was 2004 it was released though, 14 years ago!	 
I see. i didn't realize it was 14 years ago. you're right. Man. now I feel old. i remember seeing this in the theaters. i guess you disagree that it's one of top 50 teen comedies, at least according to rotten  tomatoes	 
I suppose it's just all about personal preference, my favourite American comedy films include anything with Will Ferrol & Seth Rogan so more slapstick films. I'm sure this was the movie that made Lindsay Lohan huge even though she had starred in m ovies from her early years	 
This was one of lindsay lohan's bigger successes. it made her very well known. although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too. she was so pretty in this film. it made a fan out of me.	 
Well I'm glad it was as big as it was as the message it sent out to teenage girls hopefully got through to some because high school days are stressful enough to be worrying about why you are/aren't in a clique. It's good to be different!	 
sure. That's the point of the self help book. For girls high school can be pretty tough and the movie makes it light of that andat the same time turns it into silly self examination of how kids behave. it's not without a basis that rolling stones called a comic gold. 	 
I can still remember the pressure of that stage in life and it was a long time ago although my daughter is nearly 13 so I;m trying to make sure she has the self confidence to not feel the need to follow the in crowd as the damage it can do to teenage girls can be very serious	 
it's funny how the character was home schooled because her parents were zoologists working in africa. no wonder she had to be educated on the clicks in the beginning  of the movie. 	 
Makes hoe schooling very appealing. I love how the 'mean girls' are known as the plastics, all fake	 
yeah, that's the part of genius writing on tina fey's part. she's really one of the most talented comedians of our time, in my opinion	 
Very clever woman. It def stood out from all the other American teen movies that were so popular around that time	 
yeah. more often than not, teen comedies tend to be slap stick type. this was a lot more cerebral. i wonder if the actress who played regina did any more movies. she was fantastic in the movie 	 
Same with the director, Mark Waters. I cannot think of any other movies he directed but surely he must have made more successful films	 
yeah can't recall any of his other movies. amanda seyfried did pretty well after the mean girls though 	 
It;s not very often a movie gets a CinemaScore A and I'm glad it did as it sent out a very positive message	 
I usually don't trust those scores so much. i tend to go with viewer ratings instead of critics ratings. people have better tastes than critics. 	 
Yeah I agree especially about Rotten Tomatoes, I've really enjoyed movies before that if having read the reviews beforehand would have maybe put me off & resulted in me missing a good movie!	 
yeah and critics have certain snob appeal. they tend to like movies that are artsy, although it's not all that entertaining. personally i prefer to be entertained. i mean i like some snobbish movies, but still	 
I'm really interested to find out the where exactly this film came within the top 50 result of teen comedies	 
huh. that's a good question. i don't know that either. i'd say pretty high probably in the top 10. 	 
hello you there? 	 
I will be finding out soon lol. I am going to guess that American Pie being no1.. I love the irony of Cady breaking the plastic crown at the end 	 
american pie is the classic slap stick teen comedy. and it was good. anyway. that's all for me 	 
Yeah me too, was great talking to you. Take care :)	 
how do we submit the task?	 
This is my 1st time! Urs too?	 
Hello!	 
Hi! Just reading about "The Blind Side" movie - have you seen it?	 
I've never seen it. What's it about?	 
It's got a few things going on - family (well-off folks adopt a poor teenager), sports (teen's a football star, how will he get into college?), and some social commentary about all of the above.	 
Oh, and it's based on a true story.	 
Ah I see. Who is the story based on?	 
An NFL player named Michael Oher. He played for Baltimore.	 
Ah, I see. Who plays him?	 
He's played by Quinton Aaron. I don't know the name - do you? Maybe I'd recognize his photo...	 
I don't recognize it either. What position does he play in the movie?	 
Also, I forgot to say - the story's also based on his real family, the Tuohys.	 
He's an offensive lineman - a big, athletic guy.	 
Got it! Are there any star actor/actresses in it?	 
Yes - Sandra Bullock is the mother, and Tim McGraw is the father. I didn't know he acted, did you? 	 
I didn't either! That's wild. Did you enjoy the movie?	 
Yeah, it's interesting when stars in other areas cross over to new ones, right?	 
The movie was good - above average for sure, but not astounding. Which is a fine thing, for a movie, yes?	 
It can be, but not always. I'm personally not that interested in Sports. How heavily does that impact my ability to watch it?	 
I hear you - I'm not super-into Sports, either. There's a lot more going on that makes it a good watch: Michael runs away from foster care + football offers a way for him to feel better about himself and life; Leigh Anne's friends question the safety of adopting him via thinly veiled racism and classism; there's a bit about him becoming comfortable with his talents. Sound any better? :)	 
That definitely makes it sound a little better. I heard there was some backlash about the racial parts of the movie. Do you think any part of the movie made you uncomfortable?	 
There were some complaints that it's too pat - say, everything went so smoothly despite all the pain the boy had endured b/c of his drug-addict mother, feeling unloved, that sort of (awful) thing. Aside from what I mentioned above (the mom's racist friends - whom she rebukes), I don't know about any other backlash. What did you hear?	 
Just that some people found it offensive. Then again, who doesn't find things offensive? What else did you enjoy about the film?	 
That's true. Maybe some people didn't like that it was a white family helping a black boy? I'm not sure. I did like when they got Michael a tutor - she was outspoken and nice, so her personality added some fun to the goings-on. And seeing him become happier and feel loved while doing better at football was great...inspiring, hopeful, that sort of thing. 	 
Is there anything that you didn't like about the movie?	 
Not dislike, per se, but there were elements that were harder to watch. For example, the scene w/ the mother's racist friends was disturbing - not least b/c it was so realistic. And when Michael goes back to his childhood home and his time with the gang members there turns violent, it's stressful and sad to think it might derail Michael's future.	 
It seems like they tackled the reality of the situation really well. It would make me uncomfortable to see the more racist elements, but that is a part of life. I hope the movie helps other people see the reasons to try and overcome issues. Do you have a favorite scene?	 
Yes, I agree - it's good to show it, and good to make people uncomfortable, so they think about it and hopefully see what's wrong. I think my favorite scene is when Michael questions Leigh Anne (mother) about her motives for taking him in. It was an important conversation to have, and not an easy one, but ultimately Michael's okay w/ what she says - and it shows that he's finally feeling safe enough to have opinions about things.	 
Wow. That seems really moving honestly.	 
Does he decide to go to college?	 
Yes, it was moving! I teared up, for sure.	 
I bet! I would too	 
And yes, he does decide to go to college. The parts w/ the tutor are in pursuit of that - the family and Miss Sue all work together to help him catch up on the work he's missed, and move forward, too.	 
I remember seeing this movie as a child and thought it was very funny	 
I also saw the movie as a kid.  I remember it being funny.	 
Watching it as an adult now you see it from a different perspective	 
what do you think the critic means by saying "sadistic festival of adult bashing"?   It would be a different perspective, but I still think it would be funny, dont you?	 
I read that also and don't really get it either.  I still find it funny and don't see it as adult bashing.  What are your thoughts?	 
I don't see it as adult bashing.  Maybe I forgot some parts.  But I could see it happening. accidents do happen.  	 
When you have that big of a family it definitely could happen.  I do agree with the first critic saying the first half is flat.  I remember it taking a bit to become funny.  All the funny parts are the pranks he plays on the robbers	 
Yes, I agree!  Do you remember who Marley was? Played by Roberts Blossom?  I don't remember that character. 4	 
Was he the old guy that lived next door that they kids were all freaked out by?  	 
Maybe, I don't really remember that part. 	 
Did the story just change on the side	 
I don't think mine did yet.	 
Yes it did	 
Ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story. 	 
I think the description up top got longer	 
I think maybe the top part, the key scene changed?	 
now another key scene was added.	 
Yes it added a second key scene.  The one where Kate realizes he is missing and tries to get a flight home	 
I see that.  I didn't remember that was the moms name even.  I better rewatch it and refresh my memory. 	 
I saw it a few years ago again.  Its a fun Christmas movie.  I remember Gus the polka band player was played by John Candy	 
It makes me want to watch it again.  How many did they make?  Three?	 
I think you are right that there are 3.  I never saw the other 2.  Usually remakes are not that good.	 
I agree.  I think I saw all of them, but I don't remember them that well.  I'm even thinking the last one wasn't the same characters, but I could be wrong. 	 
Plus how many times are you going to leave your kid behind. I see they added another scene.  How the robbers got caught and Kevin reuniting with his mom and family	 
That is a good part of the movie.  I can't imagine how the mom felt.  	 
I can't either.  She probably felt horrible.  Funny how she fought to get a flight home and didn't want to wait but her family made it back the same exact time.	 
Yes!  	 
By reading the last seen Marley is the old neighbor guy.  Everyone thought he was scary but Kevin helped him reunited with his son and granddaghter	 
That makes sense.  I just didn't remember that being his name.  I have a neighbor named Marley too.  But she is young and a girl. lol	 
I just remembered they called him Old Man Marley and thought he killed someone and buried him.  He was always outside shoveling and had a garbage can with him. 	 
How do we know when this task is complete?	 
Funny.  Good message of how looks can be deceiving.    And I don't know.  Do we hit the finish conversation button at the bottom?  Or will be direct us when finished?	 
On the m turk it says will take about twenty minutes.  It is going on 30.  It says you have to talk 12 times, which I am sure we did	 
That is true.  I just saw at the top of my document it says this is the end of the document and now the finish conversation button can be clicked.  I looked back at the instructions too and saw that.  I think we are good and can click finish.  Thank you	 
same here.  Thank you also.  bye

Toy story is a computer animated movie featuring the voices of of great names!  It all centers around a young boy Andy and his toys.  The toys pretend to be lifeless when people are around but when they are alone the fun beings!	 
That sounds interesting. Have you seen the movie before?	 
I have seen the movie so much, I practically have it memorized	 
They must be good then!	 
Is it suitable  movie for children?	 
It definitely is.  My son is 3 years old and he has loved this movie for almost a year.	 
You may recognize some of the voices in the movie.  Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, and Jim Varney	 
Who is his favorite character  in the movie?	 
He loves Buzz Lightyear.  	 
Oh wow! That's a lot of great actors!	 
Don Rickles and Tom Hanks are great	 
Who does Don Rickles play?	 
Don Rickles is the voice of Mr. Potato Head.  	 
Nice! 	 
It must be really cool to see a movie where the toys that you grew up with are sentient and fun characters	 
Do you know about how long the movie is?	 
Absolutely!  It's less than an hour an a half.  Perfect to keep the interest of the little ones	 
Honestly, I like movies about that length too even though I'm an adult because if they're not really good, then I can get distracted and it's hard for me to sit still too long	 
I'm the same way.  It's also great because there are not any "slow" parts so it peaks your interest the whole time	 
Awesome! I'm going to have to check that out.	 
Do you know if they've made more than one of these movies? It sounds like they would be popular. 	 
Yes, there are two sequels to the original and those are just as great.	 
It's definitely  added to my list of ones to see!	 
Is it easily rented online?	 
Great!  You will really enjoy it I'm sure.	 
Yes, you can find it through your service provider or through a streaming service such as Netflix or Hulu.  	 
Cool! I have those so I will check that out.	 
Perfect!	 
I may try to see if my nieces  can come over and watch it too	 
That would be nice! There is nothing better than movie night!	 
I agree. So many of the kids movies are so great nowadays that I enjoy watching them too!	 
And they are usually pretty good about putting funny stuff for adults in them as well. 	 
That is so true!	 
Thanks for the info and I hope you have a great day!	 
Hello	 
Hello	 
I think you are suppose to be asking questions	 
Hello!	 
Hello	 
What is your initial opinion on the movie? Without going into depth? Do you like it or not?	 
Overall, I like the movie.  It has some high-profile actors.  What about you?	 
Do you think a good movie needs high-profile actors? 	 
Or rather, does a movie need high-profile actors to be good?	 
I enjoyed it, one of my favored comic book adaptations	 
Not necessarily, but I think that can help.  An actor doesn't become high-profile unless they are really good at what they do.  What do you think?

Hi	 
Hi, how are you?	 
Good. Have you heard of actor jim carrey	 
Yes, he's quite good.	 
One of his best movies is Bruce almighty, have you heard of him	 
I've heard of it. Whats it about?	 
Jim Carrey things nothing goes right for him and complains to god. Morgan freeman plays god and lets him play god for a week	 
I.T is a Science fiction comedy hybrid	 
That sounds funny, I like Morgan Freeman	 
Morgan is the man. 48% on rotten tomatoes but it’s much better than that	 
Im suprised its so low	 
I mean not rated well	 
Yea film critics are too stiff. You should watch this movie	 
It sounds like it would be my kind of thing	 
Additionally, Steve Carroll and Jennifer Aniston are in I.T too	 
Oh, I love Steve Carroll!	 
I can take or leave Jen Aniston	 
also, Steve carrell is the main character in the sequel, Evan almighty	 
I didn't know that	 
So, I should see Bruce Almighty first?	 
So do you think you will watch this movie	 
Yes you definitely should	 
I think I will!	 
And the sequel as well	 
Good clean fun for the entire family	 
I like things I can share with my parents	 
Any other questions about the movie?

hello	 
Hi there	 
What did you think of the film	 
I think its a great movie, what do you think of it? 	 
I liked it a lot, and I think it's among my favorites	 
Mine as well. I think Gal Gadot did a good job portraying Wonder Woman.	 
yes	 
and all the action was good	 
Of course. 	 
Which was your favorite part	 
Near the end, where she literally redirects the lighting to kill Ares. Yours? 	 
the fight of the amazons when men arrive on their island	 
I love that part too..	 
yes	 
and without a doubt she is a great actress	 
She is! 	 
I love how it was set in WWI era   as well. 	 
yes 	 
  and history also captivated me	 
Same here	 
yes	 
It made me want to go back to see her	 
I watched it at least twice.. it was that good.  I love female superheros	 
Me too	 
I will definitely see you soon	 
the movie	 
Yes, see you soon too.	 
 I said that soon I will see the movie	 
Ahh... yes	 
oops.	 
sorry	 
the atmosphere of the amazons and their training was the art of my favorites	 
Yes I thought hte atmosphere and such was amazing, I would have loved to live there and learned how to fight like that.	 
yes, it was all so real	 
how would have you rated this movie?	 
from a scale from 0-100	 
I'd give it a good strong nine. 	 
9 out of 10 or 100	 
Sorry. Didn't see the chat had started. 9 out 10.	 
0-100, I'd give it a 97 or so.	 
I would of gave it a 8 out of 10	 
great	 
are you a marvel fan?	 
I am a fan of comic books. At various times I've read both marvel and DC. Although, MArvel does seem to make better movies.	 
What did you think of the movie? What was wrong with it?	 
I was never into comics but watching these movies makes me more of a fan.	 
I don't think it was anything wrong with the movie. The action was awesome but I prefer other types of movies. 	 
I will admit, Wonder Woman is the first DC Movie I"ve seen since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies. I do NOT like the new Superman movies. :)	 
I have yet to see any of the superman movies to be honest.	 
My wife had a huge crush on Christopher Reeve, from the Superman movies back in the 80's. Has basically said she would divorce me if I saw these new movies. :	 
I wanted to see the wonder woman movie because its the only movie with a female superhero as the main character.	 
haha. 	 
Only female super hero... so far. :)	 
What did you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?	 
She was amazing.	 
You really felt that she embraced that role.	 
I will admit she did a good job. She always seemed.... too small for the role. Maybe I'm just comparing it to the 70's TV show.	 
I think she would be forever remember as wonder woman. As Christopher Reeves  will be Superman.	 
She did seem small for the role but she knocked it out the park.	 
70 shows compared to shows now are very different	 
due to technology	 
Yes, she did. She did very well. The movie, and the star, surprised me with how good they were. Especailly after the mess of the Superman/Batman movie.	 
I was told that the Super/Batman movie was trash.	 
I only seen a few parts of it, but I was interested to finishes it .	 
I have seen trailers and such, and a few bits here and there of Batman/Superman but can't make myself watch it.	 
I really hope Wonder Woman is the start of some good superhero movies from DC>	 
So, what'd you think of Steve Trevor? The love interest? 	 
dreamy	 
of coarse	 
Chris Pine is a good actor and his handsome looks make it better.	 
It was sad that he died at the end.	 
What did you think of General Erich/Aries?	 
I think he overdid it a bit. A little to over-the-top. I know Ares is a god and all but... I rolled my eyes everytime he showed up on screen.	 
I agree, that's why I had to rated it an 8.

Hi there	 
Angelina Jolie in Maleficent was amazing!	 
I haven't seen Maleficent.	 
It's like Sleeping Beauty but not animated.	 
"Maleficent" gets rid of stereotypes found in Frozen.	 
Oh I haven't seen Frozen. Maleficent is considered a Superhero Genre	 
Oh really, that is kind of weird. I would have thought it was more of a Fantasy.	 
It would make more sense! It is from Disney!	 
Still for it's limits, it is improbably fun to watch, due to it's characters.	 
My favorite character is probably Angelina Jolie's because she is a great actress!	 
Well, she meets and falls in love with a boy named Stefan.	 
And they grow apart. She is the protector of the Moors forest.	 
It's sad that Stefan drugs her and cuts her wings with Iron.	 
She gets payback. I like that!!	 
Maleficent basically gets a bird to spy on Stefan like a stalker. It's quite funny.	 
Despite her dislike, She cares for Aurora and watches over her. 	 
I think she is still a good person, just jaded.	 
Well, Aurora refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. 	 
Oh, that is funny. I think there is a link to Cinderella!	 
Oh right, because she has a fairy godmother. I love the multi-universe concept. Disney did that with Marvel. 	 
I haven't seen much Marvel. I think that Aurora is going to betray Maleficent. 	 
It looks like Aurora told Stefan about Maleficent. 	 
So Aurora is supposed to be Sleeping Beauty!	 
Oh, and Maleficent is the dark witch?	 
Oh wow Disney, you did a good one! 	 
But Maleficent awakens Sleeping Beauty?	 
Wait, so there is no prince charming?	 
Doesn't look like it.	 
Wow, Maleficent tried to let Stefan live and Stefan just had forever rage for her.	 
Yea, I think Maleficent cheated on him or something. 	 
That is like true love.	 
That is crazy love. If you can't be in love with someone, then no one can?	 
I see what you mean.	 
Well, I want to watch the movie now.	 
I think that I might watch it, but it's not at the top of my list.	 
Yes, Marvel is far better, but all Disney is good!	 
hi	 
Hello!	 
The shape of water is a great movie	 
I have not heard about this movie before	 
it is a 2017 fantasy Drama movie	 
I love fantasy	 
did you see it?	 
yes , I did	 
Sally Hawkins was the main actress	 
It say that a custodian falls in love with an amphibian creature?!	 
yes she did	 
and she kidnapped it to save it's life and kept it in her bathtup	 
wow that sounds intriguing! 	 
was it human like as far as communication goes?	 
not so sure	 
it is a humanoid amphibian	 
Hmmm, sounds a lot like those story about Mermaid-like creatures that our government is supposedly trying to hide!:-)	 
exactly	 
Does it have a happy ending?	 
it was captured by secret government laboratory	 
it is kinda open ended ending	 
you can either think about it as sad or happy	 
it depends	 
did she release it back?	 
yes	 
Well, I guess that's a happy ending then!	 
ummm no spoiler :)	 
you should watch it yourself	 
do you watch movies based on the cast or the rating?	 
I know:-), I'm so curious now! I will definitely check it out this weekend! 	 
Umm, based on cast mainly, I have different taste from most people and ratings	 
enjoy it )	 
Thanks for telling me about it, sounds really interesting!	 
it has good ratings  too and the cast are so talented 	 
enjoy watching	 
bye :)	 
thanks! bye	 
What do you think about this wonderful movie?	 
Movie name	 
zootopia	 
Oh, it's a good one,my kids love that movie	 
 If I love her too, it really entertains me a lot, although it is still for children	 
Very much but it's ok to watch because kid's like asking questions during movie's	 
 if we must always be attentive, a question how long this study lasts?	 
20 min?	 
What do you think it's a good part in the middle of the movie	 
 no doubt, the lazy part	 
There's about 5 questions then it should wrap up.	 
 and what is your favorite part	 
I think from the title I would say the fact that there's animals and it's a kid friendly movie	 
 Can this study be repeated?	 
 You have not really seen the movie ...	 
I might have can you get indeep with your favorite seen of the movie.	 
 but you did not do it, then because you choose it if you did not see it	 
Hope you enjoyed the movie, from what you said I don't know to much about it, I'll have to check it out sometime soon .	 
Hey still here?	 
yes	 
It's still not finished .	 
sorry	 
 if it's a pretty interesting movie to hang out	 
 Where are you from?	 
California I'm always here watching movies	 
Well, it's a very good way to distract the mind	 
 I need another account in mturk and they do not approve me: / I'm desperate
